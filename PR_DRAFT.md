## Title
Add manual LCP scheduling and onboarding helpers

## Summary
- Add a quick-start checklist with jump-to-next-needed step and reset in ForensicSuite to guide beginners through essentials.
- Provide recommended baseline autofill and clearer WLE/YFS guidance in EarningsStep so users don’t have to guess economic assumptions.
- Add brief cues in SummaryStep and ReportStep to clarify active scenario selection and which scenarios flow into exports.
- Enable manual LCP scheduling with start/end-year ranges, recurrence interval input, and per-year checkboxes (plus select/clear/fill-every-N helpers), with math and samples updated accordingly.

## Testing
- Not run (UI/logic changes).
